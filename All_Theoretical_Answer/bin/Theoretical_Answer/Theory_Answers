Question: what are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to
 ensure that it is secure and reliable?
 1-Validating Input sent by the user before persisting in our database.We can make use of 
 validation in API in java..
 
 2-Exposing only limited data which is necessary.Sometime some apis contains password and other
 information that need not to be shared.
 
 3-Limiting the per user request in day or any time span.
 
 4-Using Strong Authentication and Authorisation
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 1-How will you tackle the challenge above?
 Ans-In my understanding.First we can convert CSV input into a structure format such as a 2d array.
 Then,we can loop through the cell and check if it contains a formula or a value.if it is a value
 we can return the value and if it is a formula than we can calculate it by using a formula parser
 and store the result.lastly, i have to write the calculated values into a new CSV File.
 
 2-What type of errors you would you check for?
 Ans-Some Errors that i would check for.
 
 1-wrong Syntax for the formula.
 2-Circular references: When like A1=B1 and B1=A1, both return to each other.
 3-Wrong cell references as per CSV file.
 4-wrong syntax for the formula:Like +"b1"
 
 3-How might a user break your code?
 Ans-There are many ways,User can break our code.
 
 1-By using unsupported functions or formula.
 2-By using incorrect cell references in formula.
 3-By using providing invalid data types:Non -numeric values in cells that are expected to contain
 number.
 4-By inputting invalid CSV  format:Not separating with commas properly
